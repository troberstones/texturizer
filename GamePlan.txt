Super Tiler
Goals:
Load a source image and then populate it with a user defined tiles

UI elements:
        Processed image display
        Stack of tile layers
                Tile Layer manipulators
        Controls for current selection
                Source Image
                Target Output
                Tile input
                Tile rotation
                tile scale
                tile opacity
                Each operation can take an input wich can be:
                        The Source
                        The current active state (i.e. all processes up to the current latyer)
                        Another image
                        Randomness controls
                        constant value
                        Random walker
        Inspection controls:
                Need to inspect the image to be tiled
                the output of the operations
                Functions:
                        Zoom
                        Pan

                Count
                Size
                base orientation
                image
                procedural function
                mask
                        alpha channel
                        image
                        function
